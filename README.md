Hub of Go basic, algorithms and configuration

Crash course by traversy media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqrbIlUwR0U&t=588s
## Installation
1. Create the workspace with this video tutorial

    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1rZ47Gj7x4

2. At 'src' path create folder's project

3. Start code with Go! ðŸ¤™

4. To run a project use go run main.go

## Algorithms
Inside path Algorithms/CompleteList/*.go

- #1 Read input from consnole
- #2 Make the sum of two vector b[i,j] = a[i,j] + b[i,j]
- #3 Program that completes a full-size vector with random numbers of 0 At 100. the program must calculate: the average of the data, the standard deviation, the variance
- #4 A matrix has a saddle point if any position in the matrix is the least of his row, and at the same time the largest of his column. Write a program that fills a matrix with real random numbers from 0 to 999 and that determines if the matrix has points chair.
- #5 It has a vector of one hundred elements that represent qualifications of five subjects of 20 students. From 1 to 5 are the grades of the first student; from 6 to 10, are theÂ second; and so on. You want a program that reads these qualifications and calculates the average of each student and that he keeps it in a second vector that will have as Only the averages of the 20 students.
